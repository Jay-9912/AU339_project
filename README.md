# AU339_project
1. Introduction

    This is the course project for ***SJTU-AU339-Network Intelligence and Optimization*** . We test the existing patrolling and dispatching algorithm in a gym-based simulation on a guard-and-thief scene.

2. Requirements

    Python 3.7, gym

3. To-do list

    - [x] multi guards
    - [x] scalable map
    - [x] thief model
    - [x] alert on theft event and perception of other guards nearby
    - [ ] patrolling algorithm
    - [ ] dispatching algorithm
